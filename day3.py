Variables?

#variable must be on the left, because = is an assignment, not a statement of equality. moreover, no spaces or symbols inside variable name. Numbers are fine, as long as they don't start the name. Illegal words: can't name it "message".

n=17
pi=3.14159
message="What ever!"
message0="Valley Girl says: "
total=message0+message#concatenates variables with +
sixteen=n
score=0
score=score+5#don't want to have to type this over and over, therefore: += -= *= /= %= Thusly:
score+=5

print total
print message*20
print sixteen
print type(sixteen) #use this to find out why something isn't working, check what kind of data is stored, bro.

# these symbols represent mathmatic functions + plus - minus * multiply /divide //integer division, which is useful to force 3/2=1. ** to the power of, thusly 2**3=2^3 or 8. % modulo, which gives you the remainder. apparently useful for scrolling backgrounds.
