Homework 15
==========================
Game Pitches
--------------------------

For this assignment come up with three game ideas (by yourself) that you'd be willing to work on.  The games have to be written in python and pygame, but otherwise you are unconstrained.  They can be in realtime or turnbased, realistic or cartoony, serious or persuassive, etc. 

Focus on one good concept for a game that could feasibly be developed by two students of unknown or unequal skill level.  You will work on it until the end of the semester. This concept can be a moment of play, how it will feel, a game mechanic, etc.  Your project will then be implementing this one idea really well.  This means do not come up with ideas like "sims 3", more like "angry birds". 

> **NOTE:** your final game may be a proof-of-concept for a larger project.

Advanced students, you are not limited to the use of pygame if there is another library you want to use. We will work together to get whichever library you need working before the end of the semester on at least my laptop and the lab machines.

### Ideas

 * [Serious Games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_game)
 * [20 Atari Games](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3679/game_design_essentials_20_atari_.php?print=1)

 * Networking - [Twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/)/[Native Python](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_networking.htm)
 * Menus - [PGU](http://code.google.com/p/pgu/)


### How to do this homework...

Come up with an elevator pitch (one really descriptive sentence that takes about 15 seconds to say) for each concept.  Mention some similar games or a genre so we can get an idea how the game may look or play.  Then make a list of what you see as the elements involved in making this game.  Place them in this file with the format like the one bellow.  Then, simply turn in your ideas as "hw15".  We will send feedback and questions through github.

Before the end of break, as producers we will "score" the difficulty of each. Then we will green light the project we feel is most reasonable to implement in the time remaining in the course.  If you don't want to get stuck with your throw away idea, make sure you are willing to work on any of the three. You will then need to present this idea on Monday so make sure you flesh out the idea and what is involved.  Also, make a list of what you can bring to the table (art, level design, awesome code) to help find a partner.

## Prototype Game
A simple point-and-click adventure game about perspective of an underachieving game programmer walking the line between pink slip and productivity.

### Genre
In the style of the old lucasarts adventure games like "Monkey Island".

### Technical Hurdles
 * bottom menu
 * inventory
 * moving character where clicked
 * unique per item behaviors


## Block Dude Adventures
Based on the classic TI83+ game "Blockdude" with metroid-vania/open world level design and multiple block types.

### Genre
Tiled puzzle sidescroller

### Technical Hurdles
 * multiple block types
 * saved state
 * level loading
 * player equipment






NATHAN SAVOY'S IDEAS:

Note: I'm really sorry this came in so late, I had some serious technical diff. with my laptop at home, and couldn't submit until I got back.


## Dungeoning 
A simple text adventure which would be a non-rpg adventure. No attributes like dex, str, etc, but only actions i.e. "Get flask". 

In a more humorous style, but with gameplay harkening to Colossal Cave Adventure.

Technical hurdles:
Mainly,  way to keep track of what actions have been performed, and more importantly, a simple manner in which to control the vocabulary available to players.



##Blockhop:
Another simple, yet addictive concept. This is the one I'm most interested in pursuing. a platformer in a non-traditional sense. The environment moves, the player only chooses when to hit "jump" and maybe add a QWOP style hover ability that requires alternate mashing of buttons. The levels would be predesigned, unless procedural generation is WAAAAY easier than i think it is.

Platformer/casual.

Technical hurdles:
Gravity
Hover ability
Level design
Menu
Score?


##Simon Says
Think ddr for your hands. A key prompt appears and the correct button must be pressed within x seconds. 

ddr/rythem based casual


technical hurdles
progamming delays
creating a random prompt system
score
menu
